workflows:
  - name: provision
    interface:
      url: workflows/provision
    implementations:
      - name: gcp
        url: providers/gcp

#
# Builds the following UX:
#
#   rigger [deis] init <NAME> [--provider=[aws,gcp,vagrant]]
#   rigger <NAME> [up, down, check, test]
#
# To get this to work I need:
#   - workflows to be able to create commands in a go cli
#   - implementations to be able to be the underlying callee
#   - the idea of a rigger workspace with:
#     - implementation-centric "home" dirs
#     - implementation-centric bin PATHs
#
